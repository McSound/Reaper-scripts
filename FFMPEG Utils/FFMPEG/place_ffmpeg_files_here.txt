If you want scripts to use the latest ffmpeg version, place its compiled files here in FFMPEG subfolder,
like that - 

ffmpeg.exe
ffplay.exe
ffprobe.exe
avcodec-62.dll
avdevice-62.dll
avfilter-11.dll
avformat-62.dll
avutil-60.dll
swresample-6.dll
swscale-9.dll
 
So script would use them instead of ones in \UserPlugins folder.
